- As a developer, I can update GitHub issue status from the orchestrator
- As a developer, I can integrate with Jira projects
- As a developer, I can receive webhooks from external systems
- As a developer, I can configure which repositories/projects to monitor

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] GitHub API integration for issues and PRs
- [ ] Bidirectional status synchronization with GitHub
- [ ] Jira API integration for tickets and projects
- [ ] Webhook support for real-time external updates
- [ ] Configuration for multiple repositories/projects

### 6. Git Worktree Management
**As a developer, I want automatic git worktree management so that I can work on multiple branches simultaneously.**

#### User Stories:
- As a developer, I can create worktrees for specific tasks automatically
- As a developer, worktrees are cleaned up when tasks complete
- As a developer, I can see the relationship between worktrees and tasks
- As a developer, I can manually create/manage worktrees when needed

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Automatic worktree creation for new tasks
- [ ] Proper branch management and isolation
- [ ] Cleanup of completed/stale worktrees
- [ ] Visual representation of worktree relationships
- [ ] Manual override capabilities for edge cases
