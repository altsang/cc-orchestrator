## Key Files (Issue #8)
- `src/cc_orchestrator/cli/main.py` - Main CLI entry point
- `src/cc_orchestrator/cli/` - Command group modules
- `tests/unit/test_cli.py` - CLI unit tests
- `tests/integration/` - CLI integration tests

## Key Files (Issue #9)
- `src/cc_orchestrator/database/models.py` - SQLAlchemy models
- `src/cc_orchestrator/database/schema.py` - Database schema definition
- `src/cc_orchestrator/database/connection.py` - Database connection management
- `src/cc_orchestrator/database/migrations/` - Migration scripts
- `tests/unit/test_database.py` - Database unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_database_integration.py` - Database integration tests

## Schema Design Considerations
### Core Entities
- **Instances**: Claude Code instances with status, configuration, git info
- **Tasks**: Work items with status, priority, assignment to instances
- **Worktrees**: Git worktree management with paths, branches, status
- **Configurations**: System and user configuration settings

### Relationships
- Instances can have multiple tasks assigned
- Tasks are associated with specific worktrees
- Worktrees track git branch and workspace information
- Configurations support hierarchical overrides

### Performance Requirements
- Fast queries for instance status and task assignment
- Efficient filtering and sorting for dashboard views
- Proper indexing for commonly accessed data

# Issue #59: Fix Instance Persistence - Complete Integration Implementation (REOPENED)
See: https://github.com/altsang/cc-orchestrator/issues/59

Focus: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REGRESSION - Database persistence is completely broken despite previous "completion". Instance management fails with database sync errors.

## Current Status
- **Issue**: #59 - Fix Instance Persistence - Complete Integration Implementation
- **Status**: ðŸš¨ **REOPENED** (Critical regression - database persistence still broken)
- **Branch**: feature/issue-59-database-persistence-fix
- **Worktree**: ~/workspace/cc-orchestrator-issue-59-fix
- **Priority**: CRITICAL (Phase 2 completely blocked)
- **Labels**: feature, phase-2, priority-critical, integration-debt, regression

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PROBLEM DISCOVERED IN TESTING

### **Actual Error Output**
```bash
cc-orchestrator instances start 100
# Output:
Failed to sync instance state to database
ERROR: Instance started but will NOT survive system restart!
This is a critical issue - contact system administrator
Successfully started Claude instance for issue 100
Failed to register instance with health monitor
Process no longer exists for database instance, marking as stopped
```

### **Persistence Test Failure**
```bash
cc-orchestrator instances list
# Output: No active instances found.
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**
Despite Issue #59 being marked "completed" and PR #61 being merged, the database integration was never properly implemented. The Orchestrator class is still failing to:
1. Sync instance state to database
2. Register instances with health monitor
3. Persist instances across CLI command invocations

## Technical Requirements (Issue #59 - CRITICAL FIX)

### **CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED**
1. **Database Connection Implementation** (CRITICAL)
   - Fix Orchestrator.initialize() to properly connect to database
   - Implement proper database session management
   - Replace memory-only storage with database persistence

2. **Instance State Synchronization** (CRITICAL)
   - Fix "Failed to sync instance state to database" error
   - Implement proper InstanceCRUD integration in Orchestrator
   - Ensure instances are saved to database on creation

3. **Health Monitor Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Fix "Failed to register instance with health monitor" error
   - Implement proper process tracking in database
   - Ensure health status is properly maintained

4. **Cross-Session Persistence** (CRITICAL)
   - Ensure instances persist across separate CLI command invocations
   - Load existing instances from database on Orchestrator initialization
   - Test complete lifecycle: start â†’ list â†’ stop â†’ list

## Acceptance Criteria (Issue #59) - CRITICAL TESTS
- [ ] `cc-orchestrator instances start 999` succeeds without database errors
- [ ] `cc-orchestrator instances list` shows created instances (NOT "No active instances found")
- [ ] Instances persist across separate CLI command invocations
- [ ] Health monitor registration works without errors
- [ ] Instance stop/start lifecycle works correctly

## MANDATORY Testing Requirements
```bash
# CRITICAL TEST - Must work after fix:
cc-orchestrator instances start 999
cc-orchestrator instances list    # Must show instance 999
cc-orchestrator instances stop 999
cc-orchestrator instances list    # Must show no instances

# Cross-session persistence test:
cc-orchestrator instances start 888
cc-orchestrator instances start 777
cc-orchestrator instances list    # Must show both instances
# Exit and restart CLI
cc-orchestrator instances list    # Must still show both instances
```

## Current State (Issue #59)
ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL REGRESSION** - Ready for immediate remediation:
- Git worktree created at ~/workspace/cc-orchestrator-issue-59-fix
- Tmux session ready: cc-orchestrator-issue-59-fix
- Critical database persistence failure confirmed during testing
- Previous "completion" was invalid - core functionality is broken

## Key Files Requiring Implementation
- `src/cc_orchestrator/core/orchestrator.py` - Database integration missing
- `src/cc_orchestrator/cli/instances.py` - Instance persistence broken
- Database connection and session management code
- Health monitoring integration

## Worker 1 Assignment
**Priority**: CRITICAL - This blocks all Phase 2 functionality
**Task**: Implement the database persistence that was supposed to be completed previously
**Environment**: Ready for immediate development work

This issue represents a **critical regression** where supposedly completed functionality is completely broken and unusable.
