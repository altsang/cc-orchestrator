## Schema Design Considerations
### Core Entities
- **Instances**: Claude Code instances with status, configuration, git info
- **Tasks**: Work items with status, priority, assignment to instances
- **Worktrees**: Git worktree management with paths, branches, status
- **Configurations**: System and user configuration settings

### Relationships
- Instances can have multiple tasks assigned
- Tasks are associated with specific worktrees
- Worktrees track git branch and workspace information
- Configurations support hierarchical overrides

### Performance Requirements
- Fast queries for instance status and task assignment
- Efficient filtering and sorting for dashboard views
- Proper indexing for commonly accessed data
