## Current Status
- **Issue**: #9 - SQLite database schema and models
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (GitHub issue closed)
- **Branch**: feature/issue-9-database-schema
- **Worktree**: ~/workspace/cc-orchestrator-issue-9
- **Priority**: High (Phase 1)
- **Dependencies**: Project setup (#7) ✅ COMPLETED

## Technical Requirements (Issue #8)
- Click framework for CLI commands
- Command groups: instances, tasks, worktrees, config, web

- [x] Error handling with clear user messages
- [x] Output can be formatted as JSON for automation

## Current State (Issue #8)
✅ **COMPLETED** - Full CLI framework implementation:
- Main CLI entry point with comprehensive help and options
- Complete command group structure: instances, tasks, worktrees, config, web
- Configuration loading from files and environment variables
- JSON and human-readable output formatting
- Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests

## Current State (Issue #9)
✅ **COMPLETED** - Full database implementation:
- Complete SQLAlchemy models for instances, tasks, worktrees, and configurations
- Database connection management with pooling and transaction handling
- Migration system with versioning and initial schema migration
- Comprehensive CRUD operations with validation and error handling
- Performance optimizations with strategic indexes
- 60 comprehensive tests (46 unit + 14 integration) all passing
- Hierarchical configuration system with scope precedence
- Data integrity with foreign key constraints and cascade deletes

## Schema Design Considerations
### Core Entities
- **Instances**: Claude Code instances with status, configuration, git info
- **Tasks**: Work items with status, priority, assignment to instances
- **Worktrees**: Git worktree management with paths, branches, status
- **Configurations**: System and user configuration settings

### Relationships
- Instances can have multiple tasks assigned
- Tasks are associated with specific worktrees
- Worktrees track git branch and workspace information
- Configurations support hierarchical overrides

### Performance Requirements
- Fast queries for instance status and task assignment
- Efficient filtering and sorting for dashboard views
- Proper indexing for commonly accessed data
