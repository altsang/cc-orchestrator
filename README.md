# CC-Orchestrator

A Claude Code orchestrator that manages multiple Claude instances through git worktrees, providing both CLI and web interfaces for parallel development workflows.

## Overview

CC-Orchestrator acts as a control plane for managing multiple Claude Code instances, enabling:

- **Parallel Development**: Run multiple Claude instances in isolated git worktrees
- **Session Persistence**: Tmux integration for disconnection-proof sessions
- **Visual Monitoring**: Real-time web dashboard for instance oversight
- **Task Coordination**: Automated task assignment and progress tracking
- **External Integration**: GitHub/Jira synchronization for workflow automation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize orchestrator in your repository
cc-orchestrator init

# Start web dashboard
cc-orchestrator web start

# Create a task and spawn Claude instance
cc-orchestrator task create "Implement feature X" --branch feature/x
cc-orchestrator instance spawn --task TASK-123

# Monitor via CLI or web interface
cc-orchestrator status
# or visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Features

### Multi-Instance Management
- Run up to 10 concurrent Claude Code instances
- Complete isolation via git worktrees
- Resource monitoring and limits
- Automatic cleanup and recovery

### Session Persistence
- Tmux integration for persistent sessions
- Survive SSH disconnections and terminal crashes
- Resume work from anywhere
- Team collaboration support

### Real-Time Dashboard
- Live instance status and resource usage
- Interactive task management board
- Streaming logs with search and filtering
- Mobile-responsive design

### External Integrations
- GitHub Issues â†” Tasks synchronization
- Jira ticket management
- Slack/Discord notifications
- Webhook support for custom workflows

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI + SQLite
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + WebSockets
- **Session Management**: tmux
- **Git Operations**: GitPython with worktree support

## Development Methodology

This project follows **production-ready development standards** to ensure all components are robust, type-safe, and maintainable from day one.

### ðŸš€ Quick Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cc-orchestrator
cd cc-orchestrator
make setup

# 2. Before every commit (MANDATORY)
make quality-check

# 3. Before creating PR
make pr-ready
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Production-Ready Standards

Every component must meet these quality gates before merge:

- âœ… **Type Safety**: mypy passes with zero errors
- âœ… **Code Quality**: ruff/black formatting and linting clean
- âœ… **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage for new code
- âœ… **Functionality**: All tests pass, manual verification complete
- âœ… **Security**: Security scans pass, no vulnerabilities

### ðŸ“‹ Development Commands

```bash
# Core workflow commands
make quality-check    # MANDATORY before every commit
make commit-ready     # Verify readiness to commit
make pr-ready         # Verify readiness for pull request

# Individual quality checks
make type-check       # Run mypy type checking
make lint-fix         # Fix linting issues automatically
make format           # Apply black code formatting
make test             # Run all tests
make test-cov         # Run tests with coverage report
make security-scan    # Run security analysis

# Configuration-specific testing
make test-config      # Test configuration management
make test-cli         # Test CLI functionality
```

### ðŸ“– Complete Standards

For complete development methodology, code standards, and quality requirements, see:
- **[DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md](./DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md)** - Complete development standards
- **Makefile** - Automated quality checks and workflows

### ðŸ”„ Zero Technical Debt Policy

- No code merges with known type errors, linting issues, or test failures
- All components must meet production standards before PR approval
- Quality gates are enforced automatically through pre-commit hooks and CI/CD
