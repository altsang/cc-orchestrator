- Can spawn Claude instances in tmux sessions
- Health monitoring detects failed instances
- Cleanup removes orphaned resources

### Phase 3: Web Interface ðŸš§ STARTED
**Status**: ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS** - Development started
**Goal**: Real-time web dashboard control tower

#### In Progress:
- [ ] FastAPI backend with REST API - Issue #18 ðŸš§ (Worker 2)

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates - Issue #19
- [ ] React frontend with real-time components - Issue #20
- [ ] Instance status dashboard and controls - Issue #21
- [ ] Task board and progress visualization - Issue #22
- [ ] Log streaming and monitoring - Issue #23

#### Deliverables:
- Web dashboard at localhost:8080
- Real-time instance monitoring
- Interactive task management

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Dashboard shows all instances in real-time
- Can control instances via web interface
- Logs stream live to the browser
- Responsive design works on mobile

### Phase 4: External Integrations (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: GitHub/Jira integration and automation

#### Tasks:
- [ ] GitHub API integration (issues, PRs, repos)
- [ ] Jira API integration (tickets, projects)
- [ ] Automated task assignment and tracking
- [ ] Status synchronization bidirectionally
- [ ] Webhook support for external events

#### Deliverables:
- `cc-orchestrator sync --github|--jira`
- Automated task pulling and assignment
- Status updates to external systems

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Can pull GitHub issues and create tasks
- Can sync task status back to GitHub
- Jira integration works similarly
- Webhooks trigger appropriate actions

### Phase 5: Extended Integrations (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Additional issue tracking systems and advanced features
**Status**: Under consideration - priorities may be adjusted based on user feedback

#### Extended Integration Tasks:
- [ ] Azure DevOps integration (work items, boards, repos)
- [ ] GitLab Issues integration (issues, merge requests)
- [ ] Linear integration (issues, projects)
- [ ] Custom API framework for proprietary systems

#### Advanced Feature Tasks:
- [ ] Inter-instance coordination and dependencies
- [ ] Resource management and optimization
- [ ] Backup/recovery for session state
- [ ] Performance monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Notification system (Slack/Discord)

#### Deliverables:
- Support for Azure DevOps and GitLab (top priority integrations)
- Smart task coordination
- Resource optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Azure DevOps work items can be pulled and synced
- GitLab issues integrate similarly to GitHub
- Can handle task dependencies intelligently
- Resource usage stays within limits
- State can be backed up and restored
- Notifications work for key events

**Note**: Extended integrations beyond GitHub/Jira are still under evaluation. Azure DevOps and GitLab are the top considerations for additional system support.

### Phase 6: Documentation & Release (Week 6)
**Goal**: Production-ready release

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Complete documentation and guides
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Release packaging and distribution
- [ ] Example workflows and tutorials
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

#### Deliverables:
- v1.0 release ready for distribution
- Complete documentation
- Example projects and tutorials

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Documentation covers all features
- Docker containers work out of box
- PyPI package available
- Performance meets requirements

## Key Milestones

- **Week 2**: MVP CLI working with basic functionality
- **Week 4**: Web dashboard fully functional
- **Week 5**: External integrations complete
- **Week 6**: Production-ready v1.0 release

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Claude Code API changes**: Monitor Claude releases, maintain compatibility layer
- **Tmux session complexity**: Start simple, iterate on layout management
- **Database performance**: Use SQLite efficiently, plan for future PostgreSQL migration

### Scope Risks:
- **Feature creep**: Stick to MVP for v1.0, defer advanced features
- **Integration complexity**: Focus on GitHub first, Jira as secondary
- **UI complexity**: Use proven React patterns, avoid custom components

## Success Metrics

### Functional:
- Can manage 5+ concurrent Claude instances
- Web dashboard updates within 1 second
- 99% uptime for core orchestration
- Complete GitHub workflow integration

### Quality:
- 90%+ test coverage for core functionality
- Clear error messages and recovery procedures
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Performance within specified limits
