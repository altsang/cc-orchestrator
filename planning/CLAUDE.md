# CC-Orchestrator Project

## Project Overview
Claude Code orchestrator managing multiple instances through git worktrees with CLI + Web dashboard + Tmux integration.

## Current Status
- Phase: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation
- Next: Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure

## Key Context
- Dual interface: CLI (tmux) + Web control tower
- Git worktree isolation for parallel development
- GitHub/Jira integration for task management
- Real-time monitoring and coordination

## Important Files
- PROJECT_PLAN.md: Complete implementation roadmap
- ARCHITECTURE.md: Technical design decisions
- TODO.md: Current task tracking
- REQUIREMENTS.md: Feature specifications

## Development Workflow
1. Read current TODO.md for active tasks
2. **MANDATORY**: Update GitHub project board status to "In Progress" before starting work
3. Update progress in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
4. Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for technical decisions
5. Follow PROJECT_PLAN.md phases
6. **MANDATORY**: Create PR following standardized format (see PR Protocol below)
7. **MANDATORY**: Only move project board to "Done" after PR is merged

## üîó Pull Request Protocol (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: All Pull Requests MUST follow this exact format for consistency:

### PR Title Format
```
Issue #<NUMBER>: <Brief description of implementation>
```

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ `Issue #9: Implement SQLite database schema and models`
- ‚úÖ `Issue #8: Implement CLI framework with Click command groups`
- ‚úÖ `Issue #12: Fix unit test framework issues`
- ‚ùå `Implement CLI framework with Click command groups (Issue #8)`
- ‚ùå `Fix unit test framework issues - Issue #12`

### PR Body Format
```markdown
## Summary
<Brief overview linking to the issue>

Resolves: #<ISSUE_NUMBER>

<Implementation details>

## Test Plan
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Tests passing with adequate coverage
- [x] Code quality checks pass

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
```

### PR Creation Commands
```bash
gh pr create --title "Issue #<NUMBER>: <Brief description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<Implementation summary>

Resolves: #<ISSUE_NUMBER>

<Details>

## Test Plan
- [x] All acceptance criteria met

)"
```

## Quick Start for New Sessions
1. Check TODO.md for current task status
2. Review DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md for recent progress
3. Continue with Phase 1 implementation if not yet complete
4. Update documentation as you work

## GitHub Issue Progress Tracking Protocol

When working on issues in git worktrees:

### Progress Updates
- Post structured progress comments on GitHub issues at major milestones
- Include: ‚úÖ Completed, üîß Implementation Approach, üß™ Testing, üöÄ Next Steps
- Document key architectural decisions with rationale
- Update when acceptance criteria are met
- Provide final summary comment when closing issues

### Comment Structure Template
```markdown
## Progress Update - [Date]

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [Specific features/tasks completed]

### üîß Implementation Approach
- [Key technical decisions and patterns used]

### üß™ Testing
- [Testing approach and coverage]

### üöÄ Next Steps
- [Immediate next actions]
```

### Guidelines
- Keep GitHub issues as system of record for high-level planning and progress
- Focus on decisions and context that will help future development
- Update at completion of major milestones, not every small change
- Include links to relevant commits when posting final summaries

## Session Continuity Notes
- This project builds a control plane for managing multiple Claude Code instances
- Each instance runs in isolated git worktrees for parallel development
- Web dashboard provides real-time monitoring and control
- Tmux integration ensures session persistence across disconnections
- External integrations pull tasks from GitHub/Jira automatically
- Note: Claude executable is `claude` not `claude-code`

## üö® GitHub Project Board Protocol (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: All GitHub issues MUST follow this exact workflow:

### Status Transitions
1. **Todo** ‚Üí 2. **In Progress** ‚Üí 3. **Done**

### When to Update Status
- **"In Progress"**: Move BEFORE starting any work (never work on "Todo" items)
- **"In Progress"**: Keep throughout implementation, even when code is complete locally
- **"Done"**: Move ONLY after Pull Request is created, reviewed, and merged

### Quick CLI Commands
```bash
# Move to "In Progress" (before starting work):
gh project item-edit --id <ITEM_ID> --project-id PVT_kwHOACKAcc4A-64R --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOACKAcc4A-64RzgyLaOg --single-select-option-id 47fc9ee4

# Find item ID:
gh project item-list 1 --owner altsang --format json | jq '.items[] | select(.content.number == <ISSUE_NUMBER>) | .id'

# Move to "Done" (only after PR merged):
gh project item-edit --id <ITEM_ID> --project-id PVT_kwHOACKAcc4A-64R --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOACKAcc4A-64RzgyLaOg --single-select-option-id 98236657
```
