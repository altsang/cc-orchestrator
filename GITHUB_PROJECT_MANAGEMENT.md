# GitHub Project Board Management

## Current Status

The CC-Orchestrator project uses GitHub Projects for tracking all development work across 6 phases.

**Project Board**: [CC-Orchestrator Development](https://github.com/altsang/cc-orchestrator/projects/1)

## Active Development - Phase 1

### Issues Currently Being Worked On (3 Parallel Instances)

1. **Issue #7: Project setup with pyproject.toml and dependencies**
   - **Status**: In Progress (manually update on GitHub)
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL PATH - blocks other development
   - **Instance**: claude-issue-7
   - **Branch**: feature/project-setup
   - **URL**: https://github.com/altsang/cc-orchestrator/issues/7

2. **Issue #11: Basic logging and error handling setup**
   - **Status**: In Progress (manually update on GitHub)  
   - **Priority**: High - needed by all components
   - **Instance**: claude-issue-11
   - **Branch**: feature/logging-system
   - **URL**: https://github.com/altsang/cc-orchestrator/issues/11

3. **Issue #12: Unit test framework setup**
   - **Status**: In Progress (manually update on GitHub)
   - **Priority**: High - enables quality assurance
   - **Instance**: claude-issue-12
   - **Branch**: feature/test-framework
   - **URL**: https://github.com/altsang/cc-orchestrator/issues/12

## Manual Project Board Updates Required

Since GitHub CLI project management has complex syntax, manually update these issues:

### Step 1: Access Project Board
1. Go to: https://github.com/altsang/cc-orchestrator/projects
2. Click on "CC-Orchestrator Development"

### Step 2: Move Issues to "In Progress"
Drag these issues from "Backlog" to "In Progress" column:
- Issue #7: Project setup with pyproject.toml and dependencies
- Issue #11: Basic logging and error handling setup  
- Issue #12: Unit test framework setup

### Step 3: Verify Epic Status
Ensure Phase 1 Epic (#1) shows proper progress tracking with sub-issues linked.

## Next Phase Planning

After current 3 issues complete, next parallel batch:
- **Issue #8**: CLI framework implementation (depends on #7)
- **Issue #9**: SQLite database schema (depends on #7) 
- **Issue #10**: Configuration management (depends on #8)

## Automation Future

Once CC-Orchestrator is built, it will automate:
- ✅ GitHub issue status synchronization
- ✅ Project board updates
- ✅ Automatic assignment of issues to instances
- ✅ Progress tracking and reporting

For now, manual updates ensure proper project visibility and coordination.
